Topspin players who like hitting balls that dive sharply and explode off the court should love this string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPOWER:                \nCOMFORT:           \nSPIN:                      \nCONTROL:               \nDURABLILITY:      \n\n\n\n\n\nBIG HITTER BLACK 7 (16 GUAGE) – $12\nBig Hitter Black 7 is not only a great option for advanced players in search of a durable poly with major bite and power, but it also looks like a great starting point for big swinging intermediates who are ready to take the poly plunge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPOWER:                \nCOMFORT:         \nSPIN:                       \nCONTROL:             \nDURABLILITY:       \n\n\n\n\n\nOEHMS BLACK PEARL ROUGH (1.21mm) – $11\nShaped co-polyester tennis string of latest technology, high-tech made in Germany.

Some items come free when stringing a racket.\n\nBASIC OVERGRIP – $2 (*FREE)\nA soft, padded, cloth-like tape that is wrapped around the handle of a racquet. Three different types are available (see the red grips in the picture).\n\nPadded\nPadded with Holes\nBasic\n\n*Free upon request on rackets that are restrung.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWILSON OVERGRIP – $3\nA soft, padded, cloth-like tape that is wrapped around the handle of a racquet. (higher quality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nShock Absorber – $3 (*FREE)\nThe purpose of a vibration dampener is to reduce the shock during contact caused by the tennis ball hitting the racquet strings.\n*Free upon request on rackets that are restrung.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTOURNA RACQUET GUARD TAPE – $3 (*FREE)\nAbrasion tape that protects rackets from nicks and scrapes.\n*Free upon request on rackets that are restrung.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTOURNA REPLACEMENT GRIP – $10\nThe replacement grip (also known as the stock grip, base grip, factory grip, undergrip, etc), is the grip that goes onto the racquet’s bare wooden handle itself. It’s usually a bit thicker, to allow for some cushioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nREPLACEMENT GROMMETS & HEAD GUARD – ~$30\nThe grommets are the little plastic bits at the mouth of each string hole that keep the string from rubbing against the racket frame. Grommets can wear out over time, which can lead to premature string breakage and increased wear on the racquet. Signs that you might need new grommets include splintering, flaring, or rattling. The bumper guard protects the structural integrity of the raquet, preventing premature breakage.\nThe cost to replace the grommets and head guard is usually around $30 ($10 for labor and around $20 for a new set of grommets). Please note that grommets can only be replaced without the string, so it will require a new string job as well. Also note that it takes a few weeks for a replacement grommet set to arrive after ordering."

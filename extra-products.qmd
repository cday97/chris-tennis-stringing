### TOURNA REPLACEMENT GRIP -- *$10*

The replacement grip (also known as the stock grip, base grip, factory grip, undergrip, etc), is the grip that goes onto the racquet's bare wooden handle itself. It's usually a bit thicker, to allow for some cushioning.

### REPLACEMENT GROMMETS & HEAD GUARD -- *~$30*

The grommets are the little plastic bits at the mouth of each string hole that keep the string from rubbing against the racket frame. Grommets can wear out over time, which can lead to premature string breakage and increased wear on the racquet. Signs that you might need new grommets include splintering, flaring, or rattling. The bumper guard protects the structural integrity of the raquet, preventing premature breakage. 

The cost to replace the grommets and head guard is usually around $30 ($10 for labor and around $20 for a new set of grommets). Please note that grommets can only be replaced without the string, so it will require a new string job as well. Also note that it takes a few weeks for a replacement grommet set to arrive after ordering.
